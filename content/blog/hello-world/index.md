## About Me
I am a Software Engineer from Kerala, India. I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I started my career as a SharePoint Developer. I now focus on helping customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.

> ### My Work
I work as a Tech Lead at EY GDS India. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, M365, Azure, SharePoint Server, and JavaScript.

At EY GDS, I am part of Digital and Emerging team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.

I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.
