## About Me


### <ins>My Work</ins>
I work as a Tech Lead at EY GDS India. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.

At EY GDS, I am part of Digital and Emerging team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.

I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.

- Cloud Migration for SharePoint On-Prem, File Share to Office 365 and Azure.

#### Science and Tech
I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž.   

Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me. I still read that magazine (now Digit), I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  Checkout the Tesla auto-pilot feature- the way it works (flawlessly) is simply amazing and mind blowing.

#### Food and Travel

##### Sports
Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.  
<br>
If there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.  
The matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.
