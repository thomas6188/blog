Hi there. This blog post summarizes what I do in my leisure time. Nothing fancy, just the regular things.

#### Science and Tech
I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž. Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me except the medium- Reddit and HackerNews have replaced the print magazine. I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  

#### Food and Travel
One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.  

Fav local journey: Hometown â†” Trivandrum. KSRTC/Indian Railways. Window seat.  Cloudy weather, with light drizzle.  
Recent memorable trip: Singapore.  
Wishlist: Euro Trip.

##### Sports
Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.  
<br>
If there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.  
The matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.
