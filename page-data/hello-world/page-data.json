I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>At EY GDS, I am part of Digital and Emerging team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.</p>\n<p>I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.</p>\n<h4>My Roles and Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and Implement Modern Workplace Solutions in SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure in-line with customer needs and Microsoft best practices.</li>\n<li>Design and Develop Business Solutions, Intranet, SPFx Apps in SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure based on functional and non-functional requirements.</li>\n<li>Cloud Migration for SharePoint On-Prem, File Share to Office 365 and Azure.</li>\n<li>Office 365 Tenant Migration â€“ SharePoint, Teams, Power Platform, and OneDrive.</li>\n<li>Office 365 roll-out and enablement (setup and configuration) for greenfield projects.</li>\n<li>Design Governance and Best Practices for SharePoint and Office 365.</li>\n<li>Manage and maintain SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure environments.</li>\n<li>Participate in RFPs, Design Reviews and provide ideas, feedback, and solutions.</li>\n<li>Guide peers in understanding SharePoint, Office 365, Azure and related technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><ins><em>Leisure</em></ins></h3>\n<h4>Science and Tech</h4>\n<p>I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž.</p>\n<p>Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me. I still read that magazine (now Digit), I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  Checkout the Tesla auto-pilot feature- the way it works (flawlessly) is simply amazing and mind blowing.</p>\n<h5>Tech that I own</h5>\n<p>Laptops: ThinkPad E595, IdeaPad 530S.\nMonitor: LG 22MP68VQ.\nKeyboard: Red Gear MK881 Mechanical Keyboard.\nHeadphones: Bose QC 35 (god's gift to tech lovers), Sennheiser CX 275.\nTablet: Apple iPad (2018).\nE-Reader: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2014).</p>\n<h4>Food and Travel</h4>\n<p>One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.</p>\n<h5>Food</h5>\n<p>Fav Food: Malabar Parotta + Chicken/Beef fry.\nFav Wine: Red.

Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.<br>\nThe matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.\n<br></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"December 24, 2019","description":"Hello World"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b9fbef5e-47d7-5d9c-bf15-570d984b846b","previousPostId":"2e93beef-280c-54f5-99cb-9b231819ff4f","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
