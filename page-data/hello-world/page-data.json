I have 13+ years of experience in SharePoint and Office 365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>At TCS, I am part of Microsoft Digital Workplace team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.</p>\n<p>I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5><ins><em>My Roles and Responsibilities</em></ins></h5>\n<p>Design and Develop Modern Workplace solutions such as Intranets, Content Management, and Collaboration Portals, leveraging SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure.</p>\n<p>Participate in RFPs and Design Reviews by providing ideas, feedback, and solutions. Interact with clients to understand the business requirements and provide the right solution.</p>\n<p>Implement SharePoint On-Premise to Office 365 migration, Office 365 roll-out and enablement (setup and configuration) for greenfield projects.</p>\n<br>\n<h5><ins><em>Science and Tech</em></ins></h5>\n<br>\n<p>I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž.</p>\n<p>Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me. I still read that magazine (now Digit), I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  Checkout the Tesla auto-pilot feature- the way it works (flawlessly) is simply amazing and mind blowing.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5>Tech that I own</h5>\n<p>Laptops: ThinkPad E595, IdeaPad 530S.\nMonitor: LG 22MP68VQ.\nKeyboard: Red Gear MK881 Mechanical Keyboard.\nHeadphones: Bose QC 35 (god's gift to tech lovers), Sennheiser CX 275.\nTablet: Apple iPad (2018).\nE-Reader: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2014).<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5><ins><em>Food and Travel</em></ins></h5>\n<br>\nOne thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.  \n<h5>Food</h5>\n<p>Fav Food: Malabar Parotta + Chicken/Beef fry.\nFav Wine: Red.

Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.<br>\nThe matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.\n<br>\n<br></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"December 24, 2019","description":"Hello World"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b9fbef5e-47d7-5d9c-bf15-570d984b846b","previousPostId":"2e93beef-280c-54f5-99cb-9b231819ff4f","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
