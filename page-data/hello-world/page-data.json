I have 13+ years of experience in SharePoint and Office 365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>At TCS, I am part of Microsoft Digital Workplace team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.</p>\n<p>I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5><ins><em>My Roles and Responsibilities</em></ins></h5>\n<br>\n<p>Design and Develop Modern Workplace solutions such as Intranets, Content Management, and Collaboration Portals, leveraging SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure.</p>\n<p>Participate in RFPs and Design Reviews by providing ideas, feedback, and solutions.

My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž.</p>\n<p>Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me. I still read that magazine (now Digit), I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  Checkout the Tesla auto-pilot feature- the way it works (flawlessly) is simply amazing and mind blowing.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5>Tech that I own</h5>\n<p>Laptops: ThinkPad E595, IdeaPad 530S.</p>\n<p>Monitor: LG 22MP68VQ.</p>\n<p>Keyboard: Red Gear MK881 Mechanical Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Headphones: Bose QC 35 (god's gift to tech lovers), Sennheiser CX 275.</p>\n<p>Tablet: Apple iPad (2018).</p>\n<p>E-Reader: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2014).</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h5><ins><em>Food and Travel</em></ins></h5>\n<br> \n<p>One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.<br>\n<br></p>\n<h5>Food</h5>\n<p>Fav Food: Malabar Parotta + Chicken/Beef fry.</p>\n<p>Fav Wine: Red.

Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.<br>\nThe matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.</p>\n<br> \n<br> ","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"December 24, 2019","description":"Hello World"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b9fbef5e-47d7-5d9c-bf15-570d984b846b","previousPostId":"2e93beef-280c-54f5-99cb-9b231819ff4f","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
