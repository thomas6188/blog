I am a Software Engineer from Kerala, India. I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Power Platform, Azure, React and TypeScript.</p>\n<p>I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extension. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup drive😃.</p>\n<h3>Hobbies</h3>\n<h4>Science and Tech</h4>\n<p>I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started during my high school days when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less 😞. Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me except the medium- Reddit and HackerNews have replaced the print magazine. I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery.</p>\n<h4>Food and Travel</h4>\n<p>One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.</p>\n<p>Fav local journey: Hometown ↔ Trivandrum. KSRTC/Indian Railways. Window seat.  Cloudy weather, with light drizzle.<br>\nRecent memorable trip: Singapore.<br>\nWishlist: Japan, Euro Trip.</p>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew\">https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew</a></p>\n<h4>Movies and Television</h4>\n<p>Languages: English, Hindi, and Malayalam.<br>\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Romance, and Sci-fi. Basically, anything except Horror.<br>\nTV Shows: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/\">https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/</a></p>\n<h4>Sports</h4>\n<p>Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.<br>\n<br>\r\nIf there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.<br>\nThe matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps.\r\n<br></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"December 24, 2024","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/workspace/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Workspace"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"47aab20e-7d36-5b83-9793-593cb83dd26b","previousPostId":"98a1be80-1131-50c8-8eca-6af84e9a08ff","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
