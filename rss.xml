&lt;p&gt;I am a Software Engineer from Kerala, India. I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technology. I started my career as a SharePoint Developer. I now focus on helping customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;ins&gt;My Work&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a Tech Lead at EY GDS India. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EY GDS, I am part of Digital and Emerging team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and Implement Modern Workplace Solutions in SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure in-line with customer needs and Microsoft best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and Develop Business Solutions, Intranet, SPFx Apps in SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure based on functional and non-functional requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Migration for SharePoint On-Prem, File Share to Office 365 and Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office 365 Tenant Migration â€“ SharePoint, Teams, Power Platform, and OneDrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office 365 roll-out and enablement (setup and configuration) for greenfield projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Governance and Best Practices for SharePoint and Office 365.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage and maintain SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participate in RFPs, Design Reviews and provide ideas, feedback, and solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide peers in understanding SharePoint, Office 365, Azure and related technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Leisure&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Science and Tech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn&apos;t have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won&apos;t install with anything less ðŸ˜ž. Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me except the medium- Reddit and HackerNews have replaced the print magazine. I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Tech that I own&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Food and Travel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn&apos;t be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Food&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fav Food: Malabar Parotta + Chicken/Beef fry.&lt;br&gt;
Fav Wine: Red. Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot (both recommended by a family friend). Brand - Jacob&apos;s Creek.&lt;br&gt;
Fav Chocolates: Haigh&apos;s Dessert Chocolate Block, Whittaker&apos;s Dark Almond, Lindt 70% Dark, Aldi Choceur Dark Block, Amul 55% Dark.&lt;br&gt;
Fav Ice Creams: Haagen-Dazs cookie dough chip, Connoisseur cookies and cream, Amul (almost any flavour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Travel&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fav local journey: Hometown â†” Trivandrum. KSRTC/Indian Railways. Window seat.  Cloudy weather, with light drizzle.&lt;br&gt;
Recent memorable trip: Great Ocean Road, Melbourne.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Movies and Television&lt;/h5&gt;

Genre: Action, Comedy, Romance, and Sci-fi. Basically, anything except Horror.&lt;br&gt;
Recent Fav Movies: Avengers Endgame, Joker, The Irishman, Uri, Lucifer, Kumbalangi Nights.&lt;br&gt;
Recent Favs Shows: Silicon Valley, BoJack Horseman, The Boys, The Family Man, Panchayat.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Sports&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.&lt;br&gt;
The matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold&apos;s entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well uncritical so misled
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didnâ€™t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasnâ€™t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word &quot;and&quot; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
