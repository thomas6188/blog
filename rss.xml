&lt;p&gt;Hi there. I am an AI-native software engineer from Kerala, India. I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technology. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- Copilot and Gen AI, SharePoint Online, Power Platform, Azure, React and TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. In those days, everything was on-premises, and building custom components required a SharePoint Server for both development and deployment. One incorrect line of code could bring down the entire SharePoint farm. I still have the VDI files of those development servers on my backup drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hobbies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Science and Tech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started during my high school days when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn&apos;t have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. &lt;br&gt;
The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won&apos;t install on machine that has less than 64 MB RAM 😞. Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me except the medium- Reddit and HackerNews have replaced the print magazine. I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Food and Travel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn&apos;t be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fav local journey: Hometown ↔ Trivandrum. KSRTC/Indian Railways. Window seat.  Cloudy weather, with light drizzle.&lt;br&gt;
Recent memorable trip: Singapore.&lt;br&gt;
Wishlist: Japan, Euro Trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Books&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew&quot;&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Movies and Television&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages: English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil.&lt;br&gt;
Genre: Action, Comedy, Romance, and Sci-fi. Basically, anything except Horror.&lt;br&gt;
TV Shows: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/&quot;&gt;https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sports&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If there is one guilty pleasure I have, it&apos;s WWE (if you count it as sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.&lt;br&gt;
The matches and storylines we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Steve Austin&apos;s entrance music still gives me chills, and if you agree, gimme a &apos;hell yeah&apos;!😎
