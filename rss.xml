&lt;p&gt;I am a Software Engineer from Kerala, India. I graduated in 2010 with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Information Technology. I started my career as a SharePoint Developer. I now focus on helping customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a Tech Lead at EY GDS India. I have 14+ years of experience in SharePoint and M365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, M365, Azure, SharePoint Server, and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EY GDS, I am part of Digital and Emerging team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leisure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hi there.

This blog post summarizes what I do in my leisure time. Nothing fancy, just the regular things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Science and Tech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn&apos;t have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won&apos;t install with anything less ðŸ˜ž. Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me except the medium- Reddit and HackerNews have replaced the print magazine. I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Food and Travel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn&apos;t be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fav local journey: Hometown â†” Trivandrum. KSRTC/Indian Railways. Window seat.  Cloudy weather, with light drizzle.&lt;br&gt;
Recent memorable trip: Singapore.&lt;br&gt;
Wishlist: Euro Trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Books&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew&quot;&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6098066-thomas-mathew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Movies and Television&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages: English, Hindi, and Malayalam.&lt;br&gt;
Genre: Action, Comedy, Romance, and Sci-fi. Basically, anything except Horror.&lt;br&gt;
TV Shows: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/&quot;&gt;https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073361911/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sports&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket, Tennis, F1, and WWE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.&lt;br&gt;
The matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold&apos;s entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.
